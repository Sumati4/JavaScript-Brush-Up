# JavaScript Overview

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a popular programming language that convert static web pages to interactive and dynamic web pages. It is often used for things like:

- **Changing web page content**: Updating text, images, and styles without refreshing the page.
- **Handling user actions**: Responding to clicks, form inputs, or keyboard actions.
- **Running tasks in the background**: Fetching data from servers without reloading the page (using technologies like `fetch` or `AJAX`).
- **Object-oriented features**: JS supports objects and inheritance for more complex programming.

JavaScript runs directly in the browser (client-side), but it can also be used on the server-side using tools like **Node.js**. It's commonly used for building web applications, validating forms, and managing the behavior of the browser.

### What is a JavaScript Engine and Its Role?

A **JavaScript engine** is a program that executes JavaScript code. Every browser has its own JS engine. Some popular ones are:

- **V8** (used by Chrome and Node.js)
- **SpiderMonkey** (used by Firefox)
- **JavaScriptCore** (used by Safari)
- **Chakra** (used by Microsoft Edge)

#### How Does a JS Engine Work?

1. **Parsing**: The engine reads the JavaScript code and turns it into a structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This helps the engine understand the code.
2. **Compilation**: Modern JS engines use a technique called **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**. This means they compile the code into machine code while the program is running to make it faster.
3. **Execution**: After compilation, the engine runs the machine code and manages things like variables, function calls, and events.
4. **Memory Management**: The engine also handles memory. It cleans up unused data to free up space, preventing memory leaks.

In summary, the **JS Engine** is responsible for reading, optimizing, and executing JavaScript code efficiently.
